Bayesian semiparametric causal inference: Targeted doubly robust estimation of treatment effects
================

This repository contains the source code and data to reproduce the findings presented in the paper "Bayesian semiparametric causal inference: Targeted doubly robust estimation of treatment effects" by G. Sert, A. Chakrabortty, and A. Bhattacharya.

## About This Project
The materials in this repository allow for the full replication of the analyses, tables, and visualizations featured in our paper. The code implements our proposed Doubly Robust Debiased Bayesian (DRDB) procedure for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE).

## Repository Structure

The sub-folder `Simulation_Studies` is the main folder which the scripts required to generate the simulation results discussed in the paper.

The `Real_Data_Analysis` sub-folder includes the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS). It also contains the corresponding code to reproduce the real-data application results, which evaluates the performance of the DRDB procedure.

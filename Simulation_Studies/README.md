This directory contains the source code files that implement the DRDB method, along with various utility and auxiliary functions required to reproduce the simulation results from the paper

The script `simfun_mu.R` contains the main functions to set up and run the different simulation scenarios discussed in the paper.

The script `simfun_psamples.R` is used to generate posterior samples for the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) based on the DRDB procedure.

This directory contains the source code and data files required to evaluate the performance of the DRDB method in a real-world data setting.

The analysis uses data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS). A detailed description of this dataset is available in the book Causal Inference: What If by M.A. Hern√°n and J.M. Robins (2020).

The folder `Code` contains the main functions and scripts to set up the analysis and reproduce the results presented in the real data application section of the paper.

The folder `NHEFS` contains the real dataset and a related codebook, which allows for a more detailed exploration of the data variables.
